# Project Plan

## Title

Analyzing Climate Risk and Insights for Predicting Economic Losses

## Main Question

How do climate risks and insights correlate with economic losses across different regions?

## Description

This project aims to analyze the relationship between climate risk indices and various climate metrics to understand how climate risks influence economic losses due to climate-related events. By integrating datasets that include climate change data and the Global Climate Risk Index, we will explore patterns and trends to provide a comprehensive understanding of how different regions are affected by climate risks. This analysis will help in identifying the most vulnerable regions and the key factors contributing to economic instability caused by climate change.

## Datasources

### Datasource1: Climate Change Data

- Metadata URL: [Climate Insights Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/goyaladi/climate-insights-dataset/data)
- Data URL: [climate_change_data.csv](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/goyaladi/climate-insights-dataset/data?select=climate_change_data.csv)
- Data Type: CSV, climate metrics data

This detailed CSV file includes historical climate data that helps us understand the effects of climate change on Earth. It has records of temperature, CO2 emissions, and sea level rise over many years. This dataset is a valuable tool for researchers, scientists, and anyone interested in studying global climate trends.

### Datasource2: Climate Risk Index

- Metadata URL: [Climate Risk and Economic Losses](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thedevastator/global-climate-risk-index-and-related-economic-l/data)
- Data URL: [climate-risk-index-1.csv](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thedevastator/global-climate-risk-index-and-related-economic-l/data?select=climate-risk-index-1.csv)
- Data Type: CSV, risk index and economic loss data

This dataset contains information from the Global Climate Risk Index and data on the economic losses caused by extreme weather events. It helps us understand how vulnerable different countries are to climate change and how well they can cope with it.
